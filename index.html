John walks into his new home. He takes in his new environment. The living room is enormous compare to the tiny apartment that he shared with his goddesses like stepmother and his gorgeous younger step-sister. They are outside talking with the movers who already arrange all of everyone's heavy items in their bedrooms. He moves through the different areas of the house seeing the kitchen which is bigger than his last bedroom by a ton.

John Smith prevails as an ordinary type of guy. He is 5'10 missing the six-foot mark that the girls love by two inches. He possesses unremarkable short brown hair and brown eyes. He isn't strong nor is he weak by the standard dictionary. He is straight down the middle in the strength department. His cock however to him is the most fortunate thing that he held. A great white seven-inch cock. The three girls that he slept with back in the county, said that he was a monster compared to some of their old boyfriends. His old ex girlfriend even text about how she's going to miss his white mandango.

John and his stepfamily move to the city because of two main reasons. His stepmom, Lisa, got a better job that could pay for this house a few blocks away from the inner city lights. And because John's father died six months ago. Lisa loved John's dad and it took a lot out of her to live in the same place where he passed away. She scrambled away from past memories to this place, just to get a little further space from her late husband's resting place.
<br>
<br>
John and his stepfamily get along pretty well. So well in fact that they invited him along to the big city. They said they crave a strong male to protect them from burglaries and a load of other bullshit, but John understood they're being nice by allowing him, a guy with no prospects, to live with them.
