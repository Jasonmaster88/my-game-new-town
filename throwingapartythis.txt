Rich seem a little unsure of himself. "I mean I throw a party every Friday. Janice you can come if you want."
<br>
<br>
Lisa walk away heading inside, seeing her way out of this conversation. Another bullet to Rich ego as she left to finishes unpacking her things.
<br>
<br>
Janice look at John then back to Rich. "How about my bro?" She flutter her sexy eyelashes. "Can he come to your party?"
<br>
<br>
John could tell Rich really didn't want to invite him to the upcoming party. "Okay. He can come but he better..."
<br>
<br>
Janice said. "Thanks Rich. Lets go help mom." She pull on John hand bringing him into the house. They left Rich open mouth not knowing what to do next.
<br>
<br>
Janice giggling as they stood in their living room. "Hehe. I can't wait to go to his party. It gonna be so fun. I need to put some of my things up." She quickly ran up the stairs. John eyes following every little swish of her tight booty. He wonder where his step mother were at.
<br>
<br>
After thirty minutes of putting the flat screen tv up. John wonders if he should check on his step mom or step sister.
<br>
<br>
 
Do he check on his hot milf mom or does he check up on lovely tight step sister?
