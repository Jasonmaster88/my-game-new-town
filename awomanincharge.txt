<p>
John steps into the room and moves in to shake the ladies hand first.
<br>
<br>
“Good afternoon Miss, I’m here for the job interview. My name is John-“, he can’t get out more before the stern woman before him clutches his hand in a death grip and interrupts him.
<br>
<br>
“I know who you are and why you’re here. The fine specimen beside me can’t get his job done properly, so he begged me for the budget to employ an intern to share the load. Isn’t that right?”, her eyes turn to the other man in the room. As if feeling her look hit him on the head, he looks down and mumbles an affirmative. It doesn’t take a psychic to know who is in charge here.
<br>
<br>
“From your previous communication you will recognize Mr. Samson.” Her hand dismissively wanders to her colleague. “And my name is Mrs. Bai, I am the head of the department of Human resources and will supervise the meeting. Which, now that we have gone through the proper introductions, should start right away.” Well John wouldn’t argue about that. Even if he would’ve wanted to… That woman had a scary aura about her.
<br>
<br>
But under all the poisonous vibes, lies a stunning asian beauty. Her long silky hair, teased into mild curls. Framed by her black hair is her pretty face, devoid of age, and at the center of that her smoldering eyes. Her eyes are so capturing, John barely recognized her provocatively open blouse. Normally that would be a case for HR, but if you yourself ARE HR then that’s probably fine.
<br>
<br>
The three sit down on the oversized conference table. Mrs. Bai takes the head of the table and the men sit on either side of her opposing each other. Funny how Mr. Samson used to be an impressive figure based on emails and his portrait on the company website, but that completely crumbles when a 100lb asian lady slags him. It’s clear he won’t be the one deciding if John will get the job. John imagines if only he can leave an impression on Mrs. Bai, it’s safe to say Mr. Samson wouldn’t have the guts to propose another hire.
<br>
<br>
“Yes, thank you Mrs. Bai for handling the introductions. Mr. Williams, shall we begin the interview proper now?”, he throws a smirk your way, maybe trying to get back at his colleague for walzing over him earlier. Even from your first impression you know that’s a mistake.
<br>
<br>
Her eyes grow colder and John sees movement on the ladies end. Followed by a suppressed shriek of Samson. Through his closed mouth he fought off a high pitched wince. Neither of the two notice Johns perception of whatever that was and continue the interview.
<br>
<br>
“So Mr. Williams, as far as I’m concerned this meeting doesn’t hold any kind of necessity. The PRAD has been underperforming since its very founding, I doubt a part time intern would change that, let alone if that intern is you.”
<br>
<br>
Her eyes wander over his body, clearly looking for any weak spots. And her disappointment about not finding any is visible. When she made that speech up prior to the meeting, she probably didn’t envision John to be the embodiment of *dress for success*. That implied personal insult aside, her whole speech reeked of evil intent.
<br>
<br>
“Mrs. Bai, excuse me for asking, but how badly is the PRAD doing? As far as my research goes, the public relations advisory divisions goal is to improve the image of the cities most notable players to further local synergies. The absence of bigger scandals suggests that it’s rather successful at that. Wouldn’t you say so as well Mr. Samson?”
<br>
<br>
The friendly words brighten up Mr. Samson and must have earned John some brownie points. But only with him. The Asian persuasion on his right doesn’t take kindly to opinions that aren’t her own. But opposing her IS the plan here. They say, if you go to prison, you should instantly start a fight with another inmate to show the others you are not to be messed with. And Mrs. Bai is the kind of woman you shouldn’t drop the soap in front of.
<br>
<br>
“Yeah, you are right. The synergetic effects-“, Samsons starts, but is soon interrupted by his superior. Another suppressed whine escapes him and he lowers his view. This time John looked a little closer, expecting things to repeat, and noticed the movement of Mrs. Bais right leg. She must step on his foot whenever he speaks up, but then why is her thigh turned outward and he didn’t hear a loud stomp, so at most it could have been some pressure instead. Combining that… It probably isn’t his foot she is stepping on.
<br>
<br>
“Well, that’s neither here or there. From an HR perspective the –“, and she starts explaining in detail why the department isn’t just a colossal waste of resources, but also why everyone working there is one step away from being fired anyway. (Apparently the division regularly takes out its clients to parties and night clubs around town.)
<br>
<br>
But John is hardly listening and instead plans his next move. To sum it up:
<br>
<br>
The head of HR is an ice cold bitch.
<br>
<br>
The woman in charge of sexual harassment complains is (probably) sexually assaulting men that disagree with her.
<br>
<br>
The way she does it, is pressing her feet between a guys legs threatening to literally crush his balls.
<br>
<br>
Maybe if he steels himself in advance, he can stand the pain and impress her by withstanding the pain? That could work. Especially if she does it barefooted. But on the other hand if she still wears those stiletto heels, she will probably puncture one of his balls if he tries to act tough. That wouldn’t work.
<br>
<br>
“… after the last escapade left me with that social mess to clean up…”, she continues, John nodding along calmly.
<br>
<br>
I do have an ace up my sleeve she doesn’t know about, he thinks and sets his plan in motion. Slowly he lowers both his arms under the table, maybe the gesture seems demure enough not to be suspicious. Next he opens his fly as silently as possible. Thankfully the expensive zipper stays as quiet as it gets. Now he fishes this flaccid dick through and sets his mind to work to de-flacid it. Hot neighbour. Own Milf. Subby sist- And it hardens. Great. The trap is set. Now John just has to lure her.
<br>
<br>
“Sorry if I have to stop you right there. But that is some utter non-sense you are fabricating there. And you are seriously in a position of power here?”, John interrupts her on a visibly passionate passage.
<br>
<br>
That’s it, let’s brace for impact.

Barefoot (Cock-Shock) or High heel (make him kneel)?
