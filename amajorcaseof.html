Here it comes. Any second now. Any sec- There it is and it is skin. Yes, the game is on.

Following the moment of impact, the time around John is coming to a holt. At least subjectively. Or maybe time literally slows to a crawl based on Mrs. Bais expression. Johns eyes found hers and despite anything he assumed to know about human anatomy, her eyes snapped open and seemingly enlarged to saucers. Or close to that. The next to get the memo is her mouth, her jaw seemingly becoming unhinged and her tongue becoming visible. If John hadn’t hardened his cock in preparation for this moment, her reaction would have done the job. But as much as he wanted to bath in her disbelief, the pause in dialogue must become suspiciously long to their third wheel.

Fortunately the thing John said to Mrs.Bai just before the moment of silence was outrageous enough to warrant both the silence and her shocked face. Is Samson assuming she is about to step on my balls to quiet me? If he is, then he’s about to be in for a surprise when I don’t turn all demure and submissive next. One hell of a surprise.

“As I was saying, you are clearly in the wrong here. It is apparent, that PRAD is doing a good job and that you just can’t see how big this operation really is.”

“How big it really is..”, Mrs. Bai repeated clearly on another topic.

“I would even argue the work they are doing is the best they can with the resources at their disposal”, John continues to keep the conversation going, “On the other hand, I do see there is still potential to grow this operation.”

“There’s s-still growth potential, huh?” Ok so either Mrs.Bai has so far only dealt with pindicks or my cock really was big enough to fry this asian bitches brain.

“You see it too? For years I’ve been trying t-“, Samson tries to use Bais surprising openness to get a word in himself, only to let out a girlish quiek and avert his eyes to the table again. The ladies other foot was probably at work here…

“You were saying Mr. Williams?”, Mrs. Bai addresses John again, seemingly on her way to recovery.

“I was telling you-“, the corners of his mouth go up in a half-smile, “that the department has a lot of room to expand into.”

“Is that so?”, the not so subtle innuendo isn’t missed by the head of HR and an almost coy fashion, her foot returns to settle where it had disappeared from after her realization. The realization, that she was dealing with a bigger fish than usual. Obviously a lot bigger than usual.

“I can assure you, we can scale it up. It is just a question of how you handle it. So far this whole thing hasn’t been handled right, after I join the team-“
<br>
<br>
“Well, we are still debating whether we actually have the budg-“, there was an audible crunching sound and John is sure that was the last comment he heard from Samson in this discussion. At least on the same octave he usually talks in.
<br>
<br>
“I’m truly sorry, Mr. Williams. Please continue! You were talking about how the ~thing~ needs to be handled.”, at this point Mrs. Bai was actively moving her foot up and down Johns dick in slow, meticulous motions.
<br>
<br>
“You see, it is no surprise that PRAD has not been satisfactory for you so far. The division was just operating on a scale too small to have any impact. But if you scale it up to the size you, and the company, deserve and if it gets handled right, it will completely reshape”, dramatic pause, ”the local industry.”
<br>
<br>
The hint of a curious smile appears on her delicate face.
<br>
<br>
“Completely reshape it? Mr. Williams, this is all news to me. These concepts you are describing are absolutely foreign to me. And I must admit, with all of that in mind, it does seem the best course of action to enlarge the team and reevaluate how I’ve delt with the PRAD in the past”, Samson lightly raises his head with a look of cautious optimism, but keeps quiet.
<br>
<br>
“I am happy to hear that Mrs. Bai. It is a sign of true integrity to change your opinion based on new information and I am happy that I was able to broaden your horizon today. But I don’t want to pressure you into hiring me”, John is under the *impression* she usually is the one dealing out the pressure, “so please don’t come to any rushed decisions. Just evaluate what you need and if I fit that, go ahead and give me a call.”
<br>
<br>
John is feeling pretty smug at this point, but he forgot one little detail. His pants are still open, with his hardened dick pressing upward. The little power trip has lead so much blood to his tool, that it would raise the desk, if it wouldn’t instead press against a smooth little foot. So if he didn’t want to flaunt his dick, more obviously then he already did that is, then he needed a distraction.
<br>
<br>
So instead of rising from the table, he looks around it. If his little show of dominance is supposed to have any lasting effect, he would have to find a smooth way out of this. Fast. Mayb-
<br>
<br>
“Oh no, Mr. Williams! I wouldn’t want a so gifted young man slip out of here and have another company grab you away! No, we can`t have any of that.”
<br>
<br>
She snaps her colleague to attention. Twice, just to see him flinch.
<br>
<br>
“Samson, do we have a contract already set up?”
<br>
<br>
“Well, I do have the usual intern contract in my department, but I’m not even su-“, he starts, but doesn’t get to finish.
<br>
<br>
“Not sure that would be appropriate? Samson, for once in your carrier we agree on something. That wouldn’t be fitting at all. We need to skip that standard procedure of internship-timed contract-entry level-yada, yada and get right to the bottom of this. Head over to HR and have Mrs. Svenson draft up a new one. Tell her to use the base 2R and cut out the clauses 4, 7 and 8. She needs to tag on sub-section 11 from the 4E and- Are you getting this or do I have to literally do all the work for YOUR new colleague?”, Samson looked overwhelmed, but John guesses it’s more about the general decision to instantly hire him fulltime than the contractual mumbo-jumbo. As if to confirm that suspicion, Samson nods along.
<br>
<br>
“Yes, yes I do understand.”
<br>
<br>
“Good, have her then send that to Legal. She should attach a note that this is of utter importance and should be send back to me as soon as it is approved. Do you understand?”, she says this like you’d ask a toddler if he needs to use the bathroom before leaving on a long trip.
<br>
<br>
“Of course, I’ll be on my way. It was nice meeting you John, and I’ll guess we’ll see each other on Monday. In the end I’m glad we share the same vision fo-“
<br>
<br>
”This is urgent George!”
<br>
<br>
”Yes, of course”, he turns on his heels and leaves without another word.
<br>
<br>
Well, that worked out surprisingly well. But she doesn’t need to know that she kind of saved my ass (or in this case junk), right? Hmmm, no. Time to double down. Get it all or go for broke.
<br>
<br>
“That’s a nice gesture Mrs. Bai -”, John starts his bluff
<br>
<br>
“Please, call me Hana”, her tone is supposed to be flirty, but through a lack of experience on that field it comes out clumsy. And based on her foot loosing its rhythm, she knows that herself.
<br>
<br>
“Ok, Hana it is.”, he decides not to offer her his first name. ”Hana, that is an interesting offer and I am considering it, but I don’t throw myself onto the first opening available. I need to survey all opportunities before I make an informed decision.”
<br>
<br>
Ok, with Samson out of the way, this is Johns second chance to take his leave. He can either detach Hanas foot from his cock and zip up before leaving the table, to continuing the charade that this is a normal encounter and keep the power-play going, or he can stand up, show her his dick in all its glory and risk scrambling her mind more than the mere feel already did.
<br>
<br>
 
Show her the prize or have her hype it up in her mind first?
