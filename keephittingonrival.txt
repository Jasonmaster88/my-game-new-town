"So Sarah what is it going to take for me to bed you?" John said with supreme confidence.
<br>
<br>
The black girl shook her head in disbelief at John straightforwardness. She thought about fucking this strange white guy as she put the money on the table. A lot of fat bills as she pays to flex her and her family's wealth.
<br>
<br>
"Okay, how about you come to my room at my brother's party? And we can talk about it there."
<br>
<br>
John shook his head this time. "I don't think so. I need you to commit to fucking me before I agree to come to your house." John not letting the black daddy little girl princess hold the power in the conversation. He knew if he wanted a chance in tasting her nectar he would have to use his confidence to win her over.
<br>
<br>
"Okay... Okay." She said. "What if I promise you a hand job? Would that be enough to get you over to our house?"
<br>
<br>
"Why don't you take off your panties and hand them over to me? And when I come to your bedroom, I'll give them back to you. How about that? Is that reasonable?"
<br>
<br>
 
<br>
<br>
John up the anti as he waits to see if she is intrigued enough by him to do what he said
