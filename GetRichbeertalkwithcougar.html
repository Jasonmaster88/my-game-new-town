<p>
John text his sister about which brand of beer does Rich wants. He receives a message back instantly. Her text read. 'Get white claw loser boi'
<br>
<br>
John shakes his head and picks up a case. He should have known that Rich would want an expensive beer. He went back to the blonde cougar avoiding the black chicks. He puts it on the counter for her to ring him up.
<br>
<br>
"That'll be forty bucks," she said.
<br>
<br>
"Come on. Can I please get a little off?" He said with more confidence in his voice.
<br>
<br>
"I will give the beer for free if you come to my party during the week and serve my friends and me."
<br>
<br>
He nods. "Yes. Of course, it will be an honor to serve you. Give me your name and address so I can show up early."
<br>
<br>
She smiles widely. "Oh, boy. I can't wait to see you again."
<br>
<br>
She hands you a card with her address and name on it. Her name is Brandi, John loves her name. He couldn't believe his luck today. He must be getting a little better with the ladies.
<br>
<br>
 
Is it party time...
