John woke up in his warm cozy bed. He didn't want to face what the day has in plan for him. He went over to his closet pulling out a plain white t shirt and blue jeans. He then head to the bathroom to shower.

<br>
<br>
As John open the door he heard moaning and the water head spraying. He wonders which of the girls is washing off at the moment. John been pervy for so long. So he decides to pull back the curtains. He peel it back to see his sister, Janice, using the shower head on her pretty pink pussy.


<br>
<br>
She yells at John. "You fucking loser. Get the fuck out of here." He stood there witnessing her lovely body. She sprays him. "Leave you fucking perv."

<br>
<br>
John left not wanting to get even more drench in the water. He went back to his room to wait on his sister to finish up.

<br>
<br>
She came to his bedroom in a towel. "Hey dickhead. I'm done. And if I ever catch you staring at my body again without permission. I will get Rich to rip you apart. You understand loser."
<br>
<br>
He said. "Yes completely." John then thought about what she said. With permission. Those words stuck out to him.
<br>
<br>
 
John ...
