<p>
John spend Rich beer money on the petite mixed chick. She gave him an enormous smile as the cash swapped between the blonde cougar and John. John already thinking about spending the day with the hot punker. The date in his head was a simple picnic to get to know her than a movie, then to finish the night off deliver a kiss on her at Rich party.
<br>
<br>
The girl with a little red in her hair said while he hands the bags over. "Thanks for the free stuff bitch ass beta." She flips John off as she saunters off.
<br>
<br>
John perspective as she left him feeling like an outstanding ignoramus. His eyes were on her petite cheeks as she walks out of the shop with the food he paid for. He shook his head thinking he was such a chump.
<br>
<br>
The blonde woman shook her head saying. "Damn, you shouldn't have brought her snacks and beer. She sees you for how you portray, your confidence. A weak-minded ordinary guy. Go be dominant. Women love a stud."
<br>
<br>
John nod chasing after the punk girl. "Hey, where are you going?" The punk petite girl whirls around with a sneer on her cute face. "You forgot to tell me your name."
<br>
<br>
"And why would I do that you fucking lame cuck bitch."
<br>
<br>
John grab her arm trying to act tough. "Tell me your name, I earn that at least."
<br>
<br>
She looks up at him as she nonchalantly said. "My name is Holly. Nice to meet you dickweed. Can I leave now?"
<br>
<br>

 
Let her go or keep his grip on her arm.
