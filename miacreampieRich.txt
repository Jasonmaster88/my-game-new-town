"Fuck uhhhh here it comes bitch." He explodes into Mia womb.
<br>
<br>
Mia shook with intense pleasure. Her legs shivering from Rich final thrusts. Her face in all-out bliss. Her hair messy as Rich slap her sexy cheeks.
<br>
<br>
She stood back up with a joyful simper upon her face. Her clear juices drip down her thighs as she tries to regain composer and control over the conversation with Rich.
<br>
<br>
"I hope you didn't get me pregnant. I don't want to raise a kid right now," she said.
<br>
<br>
He smiles. "You'll look hella cute with my child in your belly, baby. Plus, your ass and tits will get fuller." He squeezes her tits as she put her clothes back on.
<br>
<br>
She said. "I'm going to go take a shower."
<br>
<br>
Rich waves bye to her then went over to John. He grins like an alligator. "What sup buddy. You like my little show with my girlfriend, Mia."
<br>
<br>
John shook his head. "No, I didn't. Why did you have to be so rough and call her so many names?"
<br>
<br>
He smiles. "Women love dominant men. They can act like they hate alpha men, but when their little goodie beta boyfriends are too sweet and sensitive. They will always call a man like myself to abuse their pussy." He looks you over. "I know we got off to a rocky start John. But I'm willing to help you get more swag with the ladies. Or I can keep supplying you with the loads' amount of pictures and videos of me fucking girls."
<br>
<br>

John knew either way Rich would still be douchey towards him but he can learn a little from him or John could see more Rich fucking the women in town
