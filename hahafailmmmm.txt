John said with nerves coating every single word. "I ah want a ummm coffee and possibly a hottie number and name."
<br>
<br>
She rolls her eyes. "Well the coffee will cost you ten dollars and the number will comes when hell freezes over."
<br>
<br>
John blush. "Oh... okay."
<br>
<br>
She giggles. John thought he somehow he manage to get on the petite punk good side. But he were so very wrong. "Oh god. You're such a loser. I can't believe you gave up so quickly. You must really hate good pussy."
<br>
<br>
"I... well... ah." John hands over the ten bucks while the four other costumers in the coffee shop stops their conversations.
<br>
<br>
She laughs again. "The coffee is only two bucks. What the hell is wrong with you? I bet you would let an alpha male fuck your girlfriend. Oh wait. You're too much of a pussy to get a girl." She took the ten dollars before he could get it back. "Here the coffee. Now leave."
<br>
<br>
John took the coffee heading back home. He felt so humiliated not only by her words but by the small amount of people who in all likelihood heard her rejecting him. The public humiliation hurting way more.
