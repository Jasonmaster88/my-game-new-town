<p>
Now that he had full control of Mia, John strode into the night. Not a single day and he already got an exquisite sample of what this town had to offer. John was feeling on top of the world. Had his life always been like this or had the move here awakened something in him that had lain dormant until now?
<br>
<br>
Be it as it may, this was his life now and he would take every slutty teen and needy milf he could get his hands on. And oooh were there plenty of options. As John walked through the near empty streets, he saw opportunity after opportunity. A park here, a coffee shop there, a university next to a mall. And was that a gym down the block? Yes, these really were fertile hunting grounds. The pressing question was actually where to start.
<br>
<br>
His home base.
<br>
<br>
No two ways about it. John had to get his own house in order before he spread the love around town. Decision made, he found his way back home, noting all the other options for another day.
<br>
<br>
The door is locked and the lights are out. Reigning in Mia and scouting the town must have taken longer than expected, both Janice and Lisa should be in bed already. His alpha instincts urge him to stumble in and just dick them both down, but one wrong move here and his stepmom could kick him out. He needs to be smart about this and lay the seed carefully.
<br>
<br>
John sneaks to his stepmothers room and opens her door silently. Wow. She lays on her covers only dressed in a sheer nighty.

<br>
<br>
Lisa is known for her shallow sleep, nagging John and Janice on many an occasion coming home late and making a midnight snack. Popcorn at 12:30? Grizzling steaks at 1 a.m? Unpacking a chocolate bar at any time at night?! Yeah, she was a light sleeper and got cranky if you disturbed her beauty sleep. Janice and John already agreed to better spend the night at a friends place then wake her up.
<br>
<br>
John undressed in the hallway and left a trail to the bathroom at it’s end. His shoes here, the jacket there … until he stood at the doorstep in only his boxers. Deeply stained with leftover cum and Mias slobber, his underwear was still a little damp. And it absolutely reeked of sex.
<br>
<br>
He undressed completely, hanging his boxers over the doorknob and closing the bathroom door from the inside. Starting the shower alone would definitely wake his stepmom up. But that could make this seem like an accident, couldn’t it? No, this was supposed to be a statement, loud and clear. John went back into the hallway and snatched his phone out of his discarded pants.
<br>
<br>
He stood in the shower, left the curtain open, set his phone on his classic rock playlist and started the water. Sure enough, John had barely felt the water hit his skin, that he heard a door creaking and steps coming closer. Until they didn’t. The last step was heard right in front of the door, followed by the rubbing of cloth and a long silence.
<br>
<br>
That’s the point of no return. He had set up the bait and it looks like his prey fell for the trap. Now he’ll just have to go for the kill.
<br>
<br>
“God, that little skank really dripped all over me. Next time I plow some sense into her she’ll lick me clean more thoroughly.”
<br>
<br>
Beyond the door a gasp was heard. And John closed his eyes just before the door opened a tiny crack. He suppressed a smirk and went on.
<br>
<br>
“Although she was barely half-conscious after I pounded her insides into the shape of my shaft. I might be to harsh on that little slut. It’s not her fault there wasn’t a real man around to teach her some manners.” One hand still washing his hair, the other gave his massive cock a shake. “But don’t worry, Daddy will take the reins now.”
<br>
<br>
A deep moan followed by the door clumsily closed, are his answers. Satisfied with himself he takes his time to shower. Better let her stew a bit.
<br>
<br>
After John got himself squeaky clean, he marches back out of the bathroom and heads straight to Lisas bedroom. She must have been in a rush, because her door isn’t fully closed. On the other hand, there are moans, mumbling and squelching heard from her room….. so the door might not have been left open on accident.
<br>
<br>
“Goooood, what a coooocky bastard~”, a deep nasal breath can be heard, even where John stands.
<br>
<br>
“Just cause he has that huuuuge cock, he ~mmmmmmhhh~ thinks he can stomp on my rules…. If only that hunk would stomp my pussy instead~” more muffled moans come Johns way.
<br>
<br>
He looks into the room and how little Lisas display shocks him, just shows what direction his life is heading right now.
<br>
<br>
She is sprawled on her bed, drenched in sweat and what can only be an abundance of pussy juice. Her sheets are discarded altogether and she is masturbating furiously. But the hand caressing her wet mound isn’t what tells John his plan had worked. It is her other hand pressing his old, reeking boxers on her nose. She looks delirious already, but each time she takes a whiff, her eyes flutter over and her hips gyrate uncontrollable. She must have been schlicking off non-stop since John started his shower.
<br>
<br>
“Mmmmmh, ah, gosh that freaking musk~ That man must sweats pure testosterone. I bet I just have to hump this jizz-rag to get an instant baby bumb~”, her pussy gushes at the thought.
<br>
<br>
Ok, listening in her is filling Johns cock at an alarming rate. A little more and he might have to get in there and slide – No. It’s been a long evening and that needy milf have to wait a little longer.
<br>
<br>
“Hey momsy, keep it down, will ya? I’m trying to get some sleep. So bite down on that thing and get it over with.”
<br>
<br>
Lisa is shocked to the core. She gasps and clamps her legs together. By accident trapping her hand down under.
<br>
<br>
“John, y-young man… this is no way -“
<br>
<br>
“What were you saying? I can’t understand you mumbling through my stolen underwear.” A sly little smile crosses his face and Lisa grows visibly closer to fainting.
<br>
<br>
“But don’t worry about that, I didn’t ask for your opinion anyway. So –“
<br>
<br>
“UUUUUUAAmmmmmmmmmm”, his sheer dismissal of Lisa having any authority, maternal or otherwise, triggers her orgasm. The only thing stopping her from hauling out loud is her cramming down Johns boxers into her mouth halfway through.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
“Ok, I’ll let you ride out that one. But interrupting the *Man of the house* is pretty rude. Don’t you agree?”, he doesn’t wait for an answer.
<br>
<br>
“And the move was a little stressing. Tomorrow for breakfast I would like a little head start. How about some bacon and eggs for breakfast?”, this time she gets to nod.
<br>
<br>
“Yeshh shuur”
<br>
<br>
“Good talk. We’ll have another about the household dynamic, but that can wait till tomorrow. Good night and have sweet dreams.”
<br>
<br>
John leaves the door wide open as he leaves the room and heads for his own. Walking down the corridor, he doesn’t bat an eye at the lurker *hiding* behind the corner. This can be a little teaser of her own future.
<br>
<br>
 
What does the next day hold in store?
