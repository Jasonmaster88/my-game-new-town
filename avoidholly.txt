John pick his favorite brand of liquor then went over to the black girl in a savory pink skirt and raven color tank top. He see her gazing through the chips selection.

<br>
<br>
"Hey, can't go awry with blue doritos or if you like spicy. Hot cheetos is the classic to buy." He said.
<br>
<br>
She swerves to meet him. "Oh thanks. But I'm actually picking up multiple bags of chips for my brother party." She picks up five brands name while walking over to the dip area.
<br>
<br>
John eyes widen realizing this could be Rich sister. He ponders if he should attempt to fuck her, to get back at the bastard for hitting on his stepsister and his stepmother. He pursues her, making sure this conversation continues.
<br>
<br>
John said. "Are you Rich sister?"
<br>
<br>
She smiles. "Yeah. I'm his older sister. My name is Sarah. Nice to meet..."
<br>
<br>
"John. The pleasure however is all mine."
<br>
<br>
She nods. "I'm gonna go pay for this party food then I'm heading to lunch. See you at the party, John." She begins to leave.
<br>
<br>
Does John tries to impress her or allow her to leave?
