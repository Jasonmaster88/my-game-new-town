<p>
John felt strange. His stomach is in knots and twisted as he finds the black neighbor hanging out near the bar. Before John joins the conversation with his pal. Rich got a phone call. He left to take it out back.
<br>
<br>
John wanted to stay where he was but he saw his bitchy mean stepsister coming in his direction. He slip out the sliding down behind Rich.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
His ears become acute to every sound as he sees his bestie talking on the phone with a mysterious person.
<br>
<br>
"I have this house full of bitches just begging to fuck my black cock. Like every slut here, wanting me to fuck them one after the other. Haha. Yeah, don't worry. I got a new friend named John . Haha, this man is a straight fucking cuck loser. I bang his stepsister. I fucking cuck him with his fake girlfriend in front of him." He pauses letting the other person talk. John could tell Rich was proud of himself and his actions.
<br>
<br>
"Look here this is your job, you suppose to be fucking every single girl you can and report back to me. Don't get too cocky. If anyone finds out what my company has done to the women and men of this town. It could be both of our necks." A mumbled voice telling into the black rival ear. Rich face looking excited still. No humbleness on his face. "Will this John become troublesome later on or shall we take him out?"
<br>
<br>
"Nah, John just a cum drinking bitch buddy and likes watching me fuck."
<br>
<br>
He is a beta bitch who just stares at his phone until I sent him videos of the sluts I'm fucking. He'll stay in line like a beaten pup. He never going to fuck a real pussy ever again. You should meet him. Haha, that man is just a joke. But he's cool, he helps me set things up. I think he is still here. I'm going to make him pick out my next slut to fuck. Yeah, yeah. I understand sir."
<br>
<br>
John slowly went back into the house. He thought about the conversation he overheard. He wonders why Rich felt comfortable bragging about himself like that. And why this company the mysterious caller spoke about would involve him?
 <br>
<br>
Does John goes home or help his buddy find a new girl to fuck?
