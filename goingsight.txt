<p>
John head outside not wanting to see Janice glowing face. He knew Rich and she must be texting with each other. John did want to see the texts between them but right now he wants to go see what the town has to offer.
<br>
<br>
He stare around the nice area. He could head left. To head into the town and try to find some cool places to hang out at. Or head down right to where the college, dorms, and Frat houses. Maybe there is a party that he could hit up.
<br>
<br>
Before John made a decision he saw a tiny light in Rich backyard on. He wonders what Rich were up to right now or who he is in at the moment. John took in his options ready to make a choice.
<br>
<br>
 

What does he choose to do?
