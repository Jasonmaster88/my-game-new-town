Rich sat in the opposing chair in a small cafe in the hub of the big city. Large marketing firms, the tallest building for the working lawyers where his sexy milf step mother works, and many condos that is used mainly by rich folks to increase their investments.

John stare at his new quote unquote friend. John read a text message earlier from Rich, which told him to come to this coffee shop. John couldn't tell when Rich arrived. It could have been five minutes ago or thirty minutes ago.

"So buddy. Today, I will help you gain confidence. To achieve this new conviction, I have to mold you into a perfect combination of Brad Pitt and of course myself. Now are you ready to fuck someone?"
