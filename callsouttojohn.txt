Holly looks at the dumbfounded dumpster fire expression upon John face as he gets called upon by his best friend to come into the room with them. Holly gives John a sarcastic wave of the hand, signaling him to walk the path he has chosen for himself. She took in so sizeably joy at his beta mannerisms. John grits his teeth down together as he starts to stroll into the room putting on a happy face.
<br>
<br>
"Oh hi Rich. You need something, buddy." John said his eyes aiming not to stare at the petite girl's pussy getting pounded into. But a losing battle, his eyes finding the point of pleasure for both parties. Rich fat black member and Piper pink stringent warm hole both causing euphoria to each other.

<br>
<br>
Rich said over the rambunctious ass claps from Piper getting nails like a good little girl. "Yeah, bud. I need an empty glass. Could you be a great pal and fetch me one." His cock still fucking the blonde girl's pussy, behaving like this is not out of the norm for a party of three.
<br>
<br>
"Okay... Um, you need anything." John asks Piper his question, trying to build a good vibe between them.
<br>
<br>
Piper loves how the man asks her if she needs something as she moans out with the black man attacking her cunt. "Ohhhh ahh nooooo. But thankssssss. Ahhhh, fuckkkk me Rich. Give me that biggggg black cockkkkk." Her words echo in his head while he takes his leave of absence from the display of raw sexual affection toward the young lovers.
<br>
<br>
 
Does John get the glass for Rich or take this opportunity to escape this lucky unlucky situation?
