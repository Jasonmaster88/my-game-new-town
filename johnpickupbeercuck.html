<p>
John heads from the house. He runs fast into the hub of Lock Heaven. So many young women, older milfs, and hot cougars walk among the sea of folks. John tries not to lose focus away from his mission of grabbing beers for Rich. He hates the idea of providing liquor for Rich party. He knew Rich are gonna try to humiliates and mentality abuse John during the party.
<br>
<br>
He throws the door open to a convenience store with a logo of a red stop sign above the entrance. He sees a hot mature blonde woman behind the counter. She wore a comic book tee and blue jeans. She looks John over, with a strange suspicion upon her ageless face.

<br>
<br>
"Stop running young man. We don't want you to knock over any of the items," she said pointing over to the stands which holds up the bags of chips and other cheap food.
<br>
<br>
John gasp for air. "Ahhh. Ohhh. Sorry. I didn't mean to come in here like a bull in a china shop."
<br>
<br>
She smiles, still with a hint of reservation in her blue eyes. "More like a cute donkey."
<br>
<br>
John took it as a compliment. "Thanks."
<br>
<br>
He walks toward the liquor section to find two cases of beer. He found his favorite brand of beer. He thought he should text his stepsister to find out what beer Rich would want. Before he chose, he saw a hot black girl coming from the bathroom. Her beauty unmatch by actresses and pornstars. She went over to the sweet sections.

<br>
<br>
John heart stutters for her. but it stops as the rude punk girl enters the convenience store. John eyes look her over as she made her way over to him with a smirk.

<br>
<br>
The blonde woman said to the punk. "Welcome to Stop n Shop."

So many options. Does he avoids the punk chick and talk with the new black girl, see what the punk girl is up too, text his sister and get the beer Rich wants, or grab the beer he wants and chats with the hot cougar at the counter

 
What does our friend that lack confidence do?
