John nod his head and picks up a case that taste the best for him. The beer is a pretty good choice, but he brought this to piss off his rival. He went back to the blonde cougar avoiding the black chicks. He puts it on the counter for her to ring him up.
<br>
<br>
"That'll be forty bucks," she said.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Come on. Can I please get a little off?" He said with more confidence in his voice. He's too handsome and charming to not get what he desires.
<br>
<br>
"I will give the beer for free if you come to my party during the week and serve my friends and me."
<br>
<br>
He nods. "Yes. Of course, it will be an honor to serve you. Give me your name and address so I can show up early." He picture her without her work clothes on. Already imagining what he'll do to her and her besties.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
She smiles widely. "Oh, boy. I can't wait to see you again." A plan playing out with in her head.
<br>
<br>
She hands you a card with her address and name on it. Her name is Brandi, John loves her name. He couldn't believe his luck today. He must be getting a little better with the ladies.
<br>
<br>
 
Is it party time
