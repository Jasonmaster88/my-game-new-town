"Oh I do love a man who knows what he wants." She brush off the retiring waitress as she went over to a booth near the bathrooms. She sat inviting John over to sit. "I'm Holly."
<br>
<br>
"John. It's is my dear pleasure to make your acquaintance, my beautiful Holly."
<br>
<br>
Holly said. "Well nice to meet you too John. So you got me alone, how are you going to impress me, stud?"
<br>
<br>
"You could give me your number. Then we can maybe decide on a place to have a date. Then we can see if we have a true connection." John said with a noticeable lack of swag and confidence in his voice.
<br>
<br>
However to his surprise Holly hand begins to stroke up his bare arm. A chilling amount of goosebumps shot like lightning across John limb. A devoid of decency smile swept across her hauntingly gorgeous face.
<br>
<br>
"Mmm you do have a way with words. Why don't we sneak off to the bathroom." she winks at John as her other hand went down below the table. Then in a few seconds a red lacy thong appears in her hand. She place the warm item of underwear into John palm. "I'm going to be in the first girl stall. If you don't cum in five minutes, I'm gonna have to get myself off."
<br>
<br>
She quickly left the table as John looks over his shoulder at Rich. Whom gave him a huge thumbs up, signaling for John to go for it. John picks himself up going to the women's restroom. He breaths deeply with nerves of noddles in the pit of his stomach. He push open the door, speed walking to the first stall.

 <br>
<br>

John pushes the bathroom door open to see Holly...
