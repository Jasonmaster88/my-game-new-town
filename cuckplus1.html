<p>
John knew what went on between his step sister and Rich. But he really did want a kiss from Janice. He looks at his hot step sister while he nods with a little sad expression. Also not wanting his first kiss to come like this.
<br>
<br>
Janice giddy lean down next to John lips. "Ready bro."
<br>
<br>
John took in a deep breathe than nod his head again. His sister lean forward pressing her lips into John's. John took in his sister lovely petite lips. At first he taste the sweetest watermelon on her lips then immediately it turns into a bitter tasting substance.

<br>
<br>
John knew what he taste on his sister lips. The seed of the black neighbor who probably put her up to this. Janice took her soft lips from him. She grin widely as she went back upstairs.
<br>
<br>
She said. "See you Friday Rich. Can't wait for the party."
<br>
<br>
Rich wave bye to her then look back at John. "Had a fun time watching cucky? Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about your favorite hobby. So you like the taste of your sister."

 <br>
<br>

Do John continue to takes Rich mockery?
