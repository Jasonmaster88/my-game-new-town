<p>
John pull the glass window open a little, to listen in on what his step family and the black guy is speaking about. John left to grab a chair to get comfy as he prepare to recline into position to scrutinize his step family actions.
<br>
<br>
His step mother, Lisa, said. "So your telling us Rich. That your father left you a house to do whatever you wish in it."
<br>
<br>
His shockingly deep voice startling John as he utters with a hint of swagger. "Yeah. My father is pretty damn wealthy. He said if I keep getting good grades in university. I can do whatever I want in the house." John step sister nod as he continue. "I do host house parties every Friday. So your welcome to come by, but make sure to wear something sexy for me." The man being very abrasive with his words toward the women.
<br>
<br>
John knows his mom will never go to a frat boy house party but his young playful sister would entertain the idea. His step sister Janice said. "I know my hot mom will be working Friday. So I guess she won't be able to make it, this time." Just like John, she see Rich face became a little sad. "Don't worry though. I will make an appearance at your party. Back home, my friends call me the cerebral party animal. I hope you can handle me."
<br>
<br>
Lisa said. "Come on Janice. You gonna make the boy fluster."
<br>
<br>
Rich said confidently. "I weren't worry about that Lisa. I can take whatever she can dish out and plus more." His hand drifting down to his crotch.
<br>
<br>
Lisa not seeing but Janice smiling. Lisa said. "Hey Rich."
<br>
<br>
"Yes ma'am." he said acting like a gentleman toward the older lady.
<br>
<br>
"Can my step son come to the party too?" she said while John step sister rolls her eyes.
<br>
<br>
John didn't know why his step sister would be tick off at him right now. He hasn't done anything to piss her off. Rich said looking toward the house. John duck his head below the window immediately not wanting to be seen watching.

<br>
<br>
Rich said...
