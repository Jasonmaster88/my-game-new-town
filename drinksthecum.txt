His mind imagines that Rich is happy having filled his cucky bestie's mouth full with his black male load. John drinks from the shot container. His taste buds detect the salty warm cum. His senses wanted to vomit out the disgusting brute contents. John swallows it hard trying to force himself to.

<br>
<br>
Piper smiling evilly with Rich staring at John. A proud look on the black neighbor's face saw his white bestie taking his cum in front of his new little playmate. A hint of his seed on John face.
<br>

<br>
"You see Piper, it's just the way your new friend is. Every time you try to fuck him. He just going to tell you to come see me. He's and I know he can't compete against me. That's why he's my good friend. And I think you are going to be my good bitch in time also. Thanks for sharing her John. You mean a lot to me haha." Rich told Piper as John finished the shot glass. His taste buds almost wanted him to spit it out. The salty sour cum reminded him of his utter self-degradation. John body shaking seeing Piper smirking at him. Rich looks happy his little plan worked out.
<br>
<br>
Piper hops off the bed cleaning out her pretty white pink pussy. Making John hunger for her, but knowing the propaganda that Rich told him, is rewriting what it was meant to be a beta. Instead, it makes John second guess what a man should really be. Rich pat his back leaving the room and moving down the stairs. Piper got dressed, slowly smiling to herself. John watch as she went down the stairs as well. The former memory still right at the front of his mind.
<br>
<br>
John left to his own thoughts. Rich being so dominant and Piper so dominant as well. He wonders why his chuckling mind found these people so hot. And why Rich is right maybe John isn't truly a man.
<br>
<br>
Rich is his best friend that is making take pictures and videos of the women in his life. However, Piper is a girl who kinda wants him. She could be his future girlfriend if he plays his card right. Even though she leans on the side of slutty, she seems perfect in his young cucky mind. However, the pressure of Rich always coming into John's love life, seems to keep him rooted in this world of humiliation.
<br>
<br>

 
Does John cut his night short or go help Rich find more women to fuck?
