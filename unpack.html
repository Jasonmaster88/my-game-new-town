"We could use a strong male around the house." John step sister said with a cheeriness that made his stomach do somersaults.
<br>
<br>
Rich smile. "Only if your mom allow me. I don't want to intrude on your first day in the neighborhood."
<br>
<br>
Every words he spoke piss John off. He wish his step mother were say no. But she said. "Oh no. That won't be a problem. Like my daughter said. We do need a strong guy to help pick up some heavy things around the house."
<br>
<br>
Rich said as John got ready to move away from the window and to appear like he wasn't watching their conversation. "Shall we head in." They all walk toward the house while Rich took a few boxes from Lisa. "Hopefully I won't pull a muscle while lifting your items."
<br>
<br>
John step mom Lisa said. "Don't worry. In that box is my delicates." She grin with a school girl tease on her face.
<br>
<br>
They barge through the door. John step mom heading upstairs. His step sister had on a evil grin while Rich study his face. Rich reach out grabbing John hand.
<br>
<br>
"I'm Rich. You must be John. Your sister told me a few little things about you." He said emphasizing the little.
<br>
<br>
John hand hurting as the guy hand squeeze harder and harder. John pull back not wanting his hand to be broken in half. This seem to make Janice giddy.
<br>
<br>
She said. "Hey Rich. Come upstairs. I got a few things that need special help to put away."
<br>
<br>
Janice skip to the top of the stairs waiting on the black neighbor to follow. Rich move in her direction as he whisper in a low voice to John. "Yo John. I'll leave the door open for you if you want to watch."
<br>
<br>
Does John go upstairs to watch what will transpire between his sexy step sister and Rich or does he checks to see if his step mom need help or neither?
