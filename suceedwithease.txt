John said in a confidence tone while looking the petite punk girl over. "I'm gonna need a coffee and your number, my sweet little snack."
<br>
<br>
His eyes on hers. She almost immediately look down. John smiles. Like a beta dog to the alpha. John likes his new presences and poises. He lean over lifting her chin.
<br>
<br>
She mutters. "Oh the coffee is..." She seems to be stun by John self assurance as she held onto a medium cup of coffee.
<br>
<br>
"Free." John said taking the coffee from her hand. "I will pay you back when we go out Friday. I got to go to a boring party but after we can decide what to do. Give me your number and name so I can call you later."
<br>
<br>
She nod meekly as she wrote her number and name, Holly, onto the white coffee cup. She said while trying to show off she wasn't just a nervous girl. "This Friday I'm gonna wear something slutty. Maybe it is for you or it could be for..."
<br>
<br>
John stops her by placing a finger to her dark lips. "For me. I will be showing you off to my new neighbors and sister. Goodbye now, Holly" Thunder taking from the punk girl as John heads out while sipping his free coffee.
