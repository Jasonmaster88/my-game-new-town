Rich stood there as Mia step away from him. He slap the side of his house in anger. He held his hand in pain. He walks inside of house nursing his throbbing hand.
<br>
<br>
John smirk while Mia walk closer to the backyard door. John walk over to open the door for her. As he push the door easily open, Mia had on a confuse look.
<br>
<br>
John said. "No need to worry. I'm not the friendly neighborhood rapist. I'm John. I live down the street."
<br>
<br>
Mia looks John over taking in his handsome appearance. She said in a sweet voice. "Oh. You are the guy that Rich said. That I should steer clear of."
<br>
<br>
John smile. He took pride in making Rich nervous. He steps over staring clearly down at her cleavage. He looks back up into her eyes.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
"Do you think Rich should be worry about me?"
<br>
<br>
 
Does Mia boost John's confidence or deplete John's confidence with her next reply?
