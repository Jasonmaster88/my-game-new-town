<p>
John felt very disgusted with himself as he knew why Rich and Piper wanted the vacant clear cup. He walks out of the room with the loud noisy dinosaur-like sheiks from Piper. He heard his best friend laughing while somehow keeping his long black cock hard. John walk from the room facing Holly, the little punk rock ebony babe with her eyes squinting at her new friend toy.
<br>
<br>
"Wow, you are such a loser. Did you have a dad in your life to teach you how to be a man? Mmm, I guess not." Her words stinging John psyche. He felt horrendous as he tries to move past her. Her small petite frame easily could be stepped over or moved to the side but he remained like he had bricks in his shoes. Letting Holly berate his male ego and persisting masculine pride. "Mmm, maybe your dad was the same. Tolerating man after man fucking your mother. Is that true little loser? Did your mom let a big hung man fuck her? Are you and your dad alike uh cucky?"
<br>
<br>
"I... Dunno." John said moving past the white dress-wearing ebony punk. He could feel her evil stare on his back as he went down the stairs. A redhead smiling at him as he couldn't stop enjoying her eyes or her large pale white tits in her bikini top. His feet carry him to the kitchen. A small shot glass was left alone and a large empty glass was also left in the sink. He walks over as he washes the two glasses clean. He wanted to take the small one. If Rich overflows the shot glass, he probably didn't have to drink a lot of his friend's seed. However, he knew both parties of Piper and his black best friend would be pretty pissed off at him.
<br>
<br>
He went upstairs with the glass he has chosen as he heard the redhead. "Hey handsome you want to get a..." He moves past her, not taking her attention.


<br>
<br>
His mind was only on helping his best friend out as he felt this time is pushing him deeper down this path. This path of wicked cuckoldry. He sees the ebony girl talking with a black guy. Who seems to be putting the moves on her.
<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I got a rap album coming out in a few months. Maybe you'll be one of my sluts in the background dancing." He said lifting her cheek as he move into a sloppy kiss. John knew this guy was no rapper. As he wears similar clothes to how Rich dresses. Long black pants and an expensive hand tailor tee shirt.
<br>
<br>
"For real. Mmm, why don't we get a room and discuss things then." Holly said with her hand on the outline of the black mystery rapper.
<br>
<br>
John sees them heading into a room down the hall as the man touches her swinging little booty. The man seemingly cracks the code of talking to a crazy girl. John held the large glass, as he wonders if he should abandon this, and watched Holly and the rapper ensuring contract negotiations.
 <br>
<br>
Does John go back to Piper and Rich or follow the new couple?
