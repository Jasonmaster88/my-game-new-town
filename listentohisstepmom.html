John travel to the kitchen cabinet. John took out a small pill container for headaches. His eyes stare towards the vessel that held the green pills. They were waiting on him to ingest them. He opens the bottle taking out a pair of two pills. John wanders a few feet toward the couch.
<br>
<br>
He tosses the pills in his mouth without thinking. He sprawled his body on the soft sofa as he tries to stop thinking about his smoking hot stepmom and his little insidious step sister in dirty scenarios. The soft silence of the neighbors coos him into a delightful slumber.
<br>
<br>

"John wake up." said Lisa.
<br>
<br>
He rubs his eyes. He attempts to question how she got back so quickly, but his lips felt super glued sealed. His mouth not having any movement as he dares to open his eyes. Thankfully they did open but to a horrific scene.
<br>
<br>
 
What is Lisa doing?
