John said. "How about a little of both?"
<br>
<br>
Rich grin with his shiny straight teeth. "Oh. So you did like seeing my BBC stretching these tight pink pussies. I can't blame you. I love busting my raw strong alpha seed into wombs. And you do too."
<br>
<br>
He eggs John on wanting to hear the words from his lips. John said. "Yes. You looked in the zone when you were creaming and breeding your girlfriend. I honestly hope you can guide me into becoming an alpha stud."
<br>
<br>
Rich slaps his back. "Don't worry, new best friend. I will have you fucking a bitch in no time. But give me your phone number so we can keep in touch."
<br>
<br>
John gave it to him. "I need to head home and get some sleep."
<br>
<br>
...
<br>
<br>
John sat in his bedroom getting a text from Rich.
<br>
<br>
'Yo bro you still up'
<br>
<br>
John shook his head. He couldn't believe he allows himself to become friends with this jerk. But he knew he may be his only hope of getting some pussy in this town. He stares at the text then text to Rich.
<br>
<br>
'Yeah what sup'
<br>
<br>
Rich text. 'yo I need you to show me your mother underwear drawer'

<br>
<br>
John knew that meant pictures of Rich fucking his hot girlfriend, but does he risk it or just blow off Rich request
