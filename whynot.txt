John walk behind the wealthy ebony babe. A small tattoo shows through her purple top as Sarah greets a large white guy in a suit. He hugs her like a good friend would, his balding head swimming in a mixture of dirty blonde hair. He took in her company. His eyes raise at John in her common clothes.
<br>
<br>
"Hey, Sarah. Is the doofus with you?"
<br>
<br>
She nods. "Yeah, I'm doing a good deed for a good deed."
<br>
<br>
"Seems like something you'll do." The large front man said as Sarah went over to an empty table. The man made sure to eye her plentiful size ass in the black skirt.
<br>
<br>
John walk up to the large fellow. "Just know big fella. When you kick a shorter man's ass, they bounce right back up, but when a giant fall, he falls hard and doesn't get back up."
<br>
<br>
"What the fuck are you on shrimp?" He said with a hint of hostility in his voice.
<br>
<br>
This man-made anyone besides NBA basketball players look short. John said. "Let me spell it out for you big guy. I'm going to fuck her. She's mine for the taking. If you get in my way, I'll fuck you up so bad, you'll be in a hospital for the remainder of your life." John brush past the heated bouncer and slash whatever he performs here.
<br>
<br>
"What did you babble about with Anton?" Sarah said a menu for the restaurant in her hands.
<br>
<br>
"Oh, I told him I would be fucking you." John you pause trying to see how she'll react.
 <br>
<br>
Sarah...
