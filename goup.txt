<p>
John waits for a few seconds giving Rich and his step sister some time to talk among each other. Then John quickly but quietly ran up the stairs to see what Rich and his step sister would be getting up to. His heart pounding in his chest as he saw the door ajar. Like Rich said. He would leave a tiny crack open for John.
<br>
<br>
As John step over slowly. He wonders if Rich saw him watching from the window. When his family were talking with Rich. His steps became slower. Not knowing what he would see, when he looks inside of his sister room.
<br>
<br>
He round up his courage as he peek through the crack of the door seeing Rich laying on his sister bed. His step sister no where in sight.
<br>
<br>
But he heard her voice. "Are you telling me? You will buy me some new clothes for your upcoming party Rich."
<br>
<br>
Rich said while staring over at John who stood there watching this entire scene. Rich gave him a knowingly smile and wink. "Yeah I will. What type of man would I be. If I didn't buy a beautiful girl like you some fancy new clothes. But before I open my wallet. I need to see your best outfit. So I can judge if you need some new clothes."
<br>
<br>
Janice said from somewhere in her new closet. "All girls need new clothes. If they say they don't. They are lying to you." She pause while John heard rustling from Janice putting on an old outfit. "So is this a good outfit for your party. Or is it to slutty."



 <br>
<br>

Rich smile like an ass while John watch. He said while taking in her hot little body....

<br>
<br>
"Mmmm too girl next door."
