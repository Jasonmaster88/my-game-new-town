The petite blonde girl smiled with braces bandaging every ounce of her mouth. The two women are very tiny, something John really like. After tonight though, he didn't know if he'll keep up Holly, maybe as a fuck buddie after he make her on of his conquests. He touches Holly's hand, then gives it a precious kiss.
<br>
<br>
"Mmm, you've been talking about me." He said.
<br>
<br>
Holly said. "Of course. This whole week I have been telling my dear friend all about a man who takes what he wants. I knew if I wanted to catch your attention at the party, I had to bring my best friend."
<br>
<br>
Piper held our her small string bean of an arm. "Nice to meet you. Holly has lectured my ears off about you. But I told her no way a man could disrespect me and I'll race to a party for him."
<br>
<br>
"Oh really." John said. "I don't want to ill-treat you. I... Like most men, just want to use our big cock and pounds the type of mantra of supremacy into your mind." He leans over to the tiny blonde cupping her pale cheek. "I think your home girl bought you here for me and I think you know why."
<br>
<br>
Piper drops her misgivings as she nods. "Yeah, I think you did get to the bottom of why Holly and I are here. But I wonder if us two woodchucks will have enough pipe to chew on."
<br>
<br>
Holly giggles. "Hopefully your not a man who talks the talk, but does not walk the walk."
<br>
<br>
John said. "When I met you earlier this week, there wasn't this amount of fire in you. But I guess you want to be an alpha bitch when a friend is near." He looks the petite princesses over knowing his cock is about to overpower these two pussies.
<br>

<br>
<br>

 
John said... "Are you ready to see if my wood is up to par?"
