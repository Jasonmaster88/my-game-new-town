John follow Rich sister to where the blonde cougar stood behind the counter. She beams at the stunning ebony girl as she scans all of Sarah items.
<br>
<br>
John delivers over the beer money to pay for Sarah party food. "Here you go Sarah. A heavenly divine creature like yourself shouldn't have to pay for trivial snacks."

<br>
<br>
Sarah smirks saying. "I don't know if your the biggest simp in the world or a very smooth talker. So I'll let you buy my snacks, but I will take you out for lunch. I won't let a man get one up on me." A playful flirty smile on her face telling him that not the truth.

<br>
<br>
John knew Rich would hate to have his sister fucking him and wouldn't like her blowing money on a him, but he could care less. He grins taking her up on the office still checking her sexy body out.

He said...
"I'll take you up on the offer."
