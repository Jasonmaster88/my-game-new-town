<p>
John went into her floral pattern bedroom. The purple and white walls burning his eyes as he enters. His hot step mom turns around seeing him. She throws him a dazzling smile.

<br>
<br>

But John could see that she is still hurting from the passing of her husband and his dad. John ask. "Mom you need any help?"
<br>
<br>
Her motherly face shines as she said. "No sweetie. I'm doing good. Oh wait." Her eyes wanders around her room fill with boxes. "Can you help me find my briefcase?"

<br>
<br>

John nods. "Of course." He begins his search along side his step mother, Lisa. He open a box looking down inside to see more clothes. Pant suits, skirts, tank tops, yoga pants, leggings, dresses, and more. Pretty much only tame items.
<br>
<br>
John eyes lingers upwards seeing his step mother face blushing as she snap shut a box quickly. John turns his attention back to searching but knowing he would come check her room, when she leave for work. He wonders what could his beautiful step mother be hiding in that box.
<br>
<br>
John opens another box to find the sleek black briefcase. He hands it over to Lisa. "So mother. Are you heading to work already?"
<br>
<br>
She nods. "Yes son. My boss, Tyson Washington, wants to see me very soon. Something about showing me the ropes. Thank you again son." She hugs John. Her titantic size boobs squishing against him. His hands stray down further wanting to cop a feel of his sexy step mother inviting tone buttocks.

<br>
<br>

 
Does John gropes his mom or chicken out?
