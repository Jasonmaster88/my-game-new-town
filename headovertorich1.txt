John went over to Rich house. John step closer to the backyard with the lights shining bright. John wonder how much money he were burning by allowing these high beam to pour into his backyard.
<br>
<br>
While John walks over to Rich backyard. He saw a stunning blonde girl with the most fattest ass possible in conversation with Rich. She wore a tight hot pink dress as Rich sounds a bit angry.

<br>
<br>
John stare on not wanting to interrupt the free show. He didn't know what he was watching, but he knew it would be good. John stood near the picket fence listening.
<br>
<br>
Rich voice loudly said. "Baby I need some release. My bbc been missing those sweet lips."
<br>
<br>
The blonde rolls her eyes. "Shut up Rich. You been trying to fuck all of your neighbors." Rich began to say something but the girl interrupts. "Nah I won't be having it."
<br>
<br>
Rich said trying regain control over the situation. "Please Mia. My balls are killing me. It been a week since I got off."
<br>
<br>


 

Does Mia walks away from Rich or does she submit to his alphaness?
